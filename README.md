## This web app...
*
1. Budgeting tool
  a. Monthly Budget Planner
  b. Special Project Planner, including a one-time worksheet for individual/family projects such as vacation, business trips, remodelling, furniture redesign, landscaping etc. Wouldn't mind all manual inputs in the beginning, just need a simplisitic yet clean look. Something better than Excel of course.

2. Monthly Payment Reminder
  a. Too many things to pay on a monthly basis with financing options for different things. A tool that helps keep track the time and progress on these payments would be so valuable. To setup the reminder, I am thinking about total amount, how many months, how to pay (equally, or minimum payment until last payment, and maybe other), when to set reminders.
  b. Reminder functionality when the preset date and time comes, either through email or text, or notification on the front page for the webapp. 

3. General Task Reminder
  a. the monthly payment reminder should be a special class of this reminder. General tasks are just one time notes and tasks, but instead of calendarized stuff, simple reminders are good enough. Although, a quick calendar look can be good too. The task reminder/notes on apple is just weird and sucks. 
  b. Grocery shopping list can also be on this, for example, grocery shopping can be another special type of task, and it can be linked to a shopping list. 
  
 4. Cleaning Schedule
  a. This is just another thing that bugs us until we clean the house. We basically set our own cleaning goal and jobs, like who does what and when. It will pop up notifications/reminders too. 
  b. Would be interesting if it's turned into the game with points and stuff. For example, you can of course delay your cleaning schedule, but you don't get as many points as if you did on time. Once points reach a certain level, you exchange for gifts and stuff. I am more thinking about this for the future with kids and so on.
  
 5. Meal Plan/Recipe
  a. Would be great if there can be a meal planner with manual inputs for menu of the week
  b. If there is an API somewhere out there for recipes, and all we have to do is kinda click, scroll, look at pictures and drag to our own menu, and populate all the necessary ingredients, and we just click on the ones we need and it goes to the shopping list, it would be awesome.
